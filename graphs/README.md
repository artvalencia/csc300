# Instructions
Please complete the `void remVertex(Vertex*& vHead, char label);`  function mentioned in the lecture video. Be sure to use the function header as written. 

Remember, that you have to remove all the incoming and outgoing arcs in the data structure along with the vertex itself. Feel free to use the remArc function we wrote in the video to make your life easier. Think about what parameters it needs as input and how you might use it in the function.

For completeness's sake, also write the `Vertex* findVertex(Vertex* vHead, char key);` function. As mentioned in the video, the code itself has already been written and can be copied from other functions. For extra credit, replace that code in the other functions with this search function. If you did it, let me know to look for it in the comments section when you submit your assignment.
